# Binary export format
# --------------------
#
# Version 1.2.0
# Supports tensors, new structs, new thresholds, export of user kernels, checksum
#
# Hopefully the syntax of this format description can be understood as follows:
# The character at the begining of this line means that the rest of the line to the right is comment.
# A data type may be simple, referring to an OpenVX typedef, or complex, when it is either a structure between
# the keywords struct and end_struct, or a variant between the keywords case and end_case where different
# data types are chosen according to the value of a previously defined data element. Variant data are introduced
# by a value or a list of values. The list of values may include a range, which is two values seperated by two dots;
# the range is inclusive. There may be a 'default' value, and if no data is defined
# between colons or after the last one, then this means no data is stored for that value.
# The data type, whether simple or complex, is followed by an identifier that may be used to refer to that
# data element.
# Arrays are supported using square-bracket notation after the identifier, and with multiple dimensions
# the last listed dimension refers to the most quickly changing memory locations. Any of the dimensions
# may have a zero length, in which case no data is stored. A length may be the value of a data item declared
# previously, or a constant.
# The names of the data elements are valid only within their bounding scope, which may be within a struct..
# end_struct sequence, between colons or between the last colon and end_case in a variant, or at file level.
# 
# The format used for the first sample implementation of the IX extension is very simplistic and non-optimal.
# It consists of a header, the set of "uses" supplied by the application upon export, a list of indices and 
# then exported objects for each of the listed indices. The files 'vx_ix_export.c' and 'vx_ix_import.c' contain
# the code implementing the export and import interfaces, separated so that vx_ix_import may be used on its
# own for the SC deployment feature set.
# Notice that thise format takes no account of endianness and so exporting and importing applications should
# have the same endian.
# At the start are 24 bytes formatted as follows:

    vx_uint32 vx_ix_id                  # Unique ID, must match on import
    vx_uint32 version                   # Version of the export/import; importing application must support version 
    vx_uint64 length                    # Total length of the blob 
    vx_uint32 numrefs                   # Number of references originally supplied 
    vx_uint32 actual_numrefs            # Actual number of references exported 
#
# Note that 'actual_numrefs' is calculated by the export function that works out what objects must be exported
# to support the objects requested by the application initially (actual_numrefs >= numrefs). Only the first numrefs
# objects will be visible to an importing application.
# 
# These 24 bytes are followed by the 'uses' array supplied by the application at export time, and this takes up a
# total of numrefs * 4 bytes:

    vx_uint32 uses[numrefs]             # 'uses' array supplied by exporting application 
#
# The 'uses' are followed immediately by a set of indices into the rest of the data, one for each of the actual_numrefs
# objects identified by the export function. These indices are each 64-bits in length and are the offset into the
# data of the byte address of the start of a data object. Wherever a reference to another object is required in an
# object description, for example the 'scope' below, an index into to offsets table is given. This index is either
# valid (in the range 0 to actual_numrefs - 1) or takes one of thes special values:
# 0xFFFFFFFF                            indicates a missing optional parameter, or NULL
# actual_numrefs + VX_TYPE_CONTEXT      indicates the context
# actual_numrefs + VX_TYPE_PYRAMID      indicates a pyramid that is not being exported
# actual_numrefs + VX_TYPE_OBJECT_ARRAY indicates an object array that is not being exported

    vx_uint64 offsets[actual_numrefs]   # indices into the data for each required reference 
#
# Following the offsets are the data blobs for each individual reference. Each object starts with a header as follows:

    struct
        vx_enum type                        # Type of the object (one of the VX_TYPE_XXX constants) 
        vx_enum use                         # use supplied by exporting appication or calculated by export function 
        char name[VX_MAX_REFERENCE_NAME]    # name of the object (from vxSetReferenceName) 
        vx_uint8 is_virtual                 # zero for non-virtual objects 
        vx_uint32 scope                     # index into the offsets table for the scope of this object, or special value

    # Following the object header is the rest of the object, the format being determined by the type of the object, as
    # given below:

        case type of
